#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is a type of engineering that deals with the design, development, testing and maintenance of software applications. It is important in the technology industry because it creates software applications that is relevant in several industries. It serves as a means to automate business processes and enhance productivity.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

a. The development of programming languages.
b. The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s 
c. The advent of structured programming in the 1970s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

a. Planning: It involves designing the project scope, setting goals and objectives and resource planning.
b. Design:Designing both high-level and detailed aspects of software architecture and user interface.
c. Development: Developing software by writing code that aligns with design specifications.
d. Testing: Executing various tests to ensure the software complies with quality standards and functional requirements.

e. Deployment:Launching the software for users or customers.
f. Maintenance: Providing ongoing maintenance, updates, and enhancements after software deployment.



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall: It is a step by step process. It is slow but steady and very linear. It is used for projects with strict requirements that would not change frequently.

Agile: It is dynamic, fast and flexible. It is great for projects that the requirements change frequently.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

a. A software developer is responsible for the 6 major tasks in the software developer life cycle. This includes planning/requirement analysis, software design, development/coding, testing, deployment and maintenance

b. A quality assurance engineer: This person ensures the software is high quality by designing and executing test plans.

c. A project manager: This person supervises the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Integrated Development Environments: These are Software applications  that provide comprehensive tools/facilities for writing, debugging, and testing code. Examples include: Visual Studio and Eclipse.

Version Control Systems: Software tools for tracking and managing changes to source code and coordinating work among team members. Examples include: Git and Subversion


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

a. Dynamic requirements: Changing requirements during the development cycle can cause scope creep and project delays.

b. Strict Deadlines: The urgency to meet software delivery deadlines can lead to hurried development and reduced quality.

c. Technical Debt: Technical debt, resulting from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, can hinder future development and raise maintenance costs.

The strategies to overcome this challenges include:
Effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

a. Unit Testing: This is testing the smallest functional units of code or individual components or modules of software.
b. Integration Testing: Testing how different components or subsystems of software interact with each other.
c. System Testing: This is testing the entire software system as a whole. It is also known as end to end testing.
d. Acceptance Testing: The software needs to satisfy the userâ€™s needs. Therefore, it needs to be tested against user requirements to ensure it achieves this goal.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

It is the practice of crafting clear, correct and concise questions, prompts or instructions to optimize interactions with AI models in order to generate useful and effective AI responses.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

A vague prompt: Tell me about ulcer
An improved prompt: Tell me about the symptoms, causes and treatment of stomach ulcer.

Improved prompt is effective because it guides the AI to provide specific, concise and useful responses.
